I'm a PostDoctoral Associate in [HyConSys Lab.](https://www.hyconsys.com/members/mahendra/) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder since May 2021. 

I received PhD degree from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ifi.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html); M.Tech. degree (Electrical Engineering) from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), India; and B.Tech. degree (Electrical Engineering) from [Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/iitismnew/), India. During masters, I was at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) for 6 months, supported by [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/) scholarship, to work on masters thesis. My current research focuses on control under data-rate constraints. 

PhD thesis: [Invariance feedback entropy of uncertain nonlinear control systems](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/28710/1/Tomar_Mahendra_Singh.pdf).

M.Tech. thesis: [Experimental Evaluation of Methods of Reachable Set Computation in Context of Symbolic Controller Synthesis](http://mahendrasinghtomar.github.io/files/MTech_thesis_MahendraSinghTomar.pdf)
